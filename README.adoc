= QSIC - QBUS Storage and I/O Card

The QSIC is a QBUS card with an FPGA and SD cards that emulates the old DEC disk
controllers and drives.

This repository is the KiCad project for the hardware, the QSIC board
itself.  In addition there are separate projects for a Unibus version
of the board, the USIC, the Verilog code that runs on the FPGAs, and
the code that runs on the embedded soft processor (not yet started).

A companion http://github.com/dabridgham/Indicator-Panel[indicator
panel] is also available for those who want the blinkenlights.
